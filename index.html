                                    career that has given her experience in a variety of areas. Starting out as a media

                                    of NBC's production crew that moonlit as faculty during their free-time. </br></br>
                                    Megan then relocated to New Hampshire and applied her expertise in branding, design,
                                    and editing to digtial marketing for higher education, where she discovered her
                                    passion for webdesign and user experience. Megan's ultimate goal is to help clients
                                    create the best experience for their customers, ultimately so they return and become
                                    life-long clientele.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Currently pursing a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of

                                    certified in Lean Six Sigma and as a Scrum Master. She successfully migrated the
                                    Career & Professional Success website to an upgraded developer platform while
                                    restructuring navigation and reducing redundancies to meet best practices in SEO and
                                    UX/I, which has allowed site visitors to find services and resources quickly.
